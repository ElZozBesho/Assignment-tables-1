Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard
markup language forcreating web pages and web
applications.With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
technologies for the World Wide Web.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web
server or from local storage and render the documents
into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
the appearance of the document.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting
language such as JavaScript,which affects the
behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of
CSS defines the look and layout of content.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards,
has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScrip.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts.
This separation can improve content accessibility,
provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
